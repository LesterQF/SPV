This project is an implementation of the following paper: Spectrum Prior-based and Visibility Fusion Method for Underwater Image Enhancement. The dataset used in the paper and all experimental processing results can be obtained from Google Cloud Drive at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CT8ugB0kPOxbAPf_XZBX78QlTC75snh_/view?usp=share_link

The code is a matlab code, for the convenience of use, all the functions are placed in the "method" folder. To use this code, just save the image to the desired path and run the main.m file.
